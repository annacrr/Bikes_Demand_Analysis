# Bike Rental Demand Analysis

This project explores the relationship between bike rental demand and various temporal and weather conditions, using Python and pandas. It includes:

- User behavior by hour and day
- Weather effects (temperature, humidity, dew point, etc.)
- Seasonal trends
- Actionable insights for business strategy

The notebook uses `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data visualization and correlation analysis.

## Project Highlights

-  Hourly rental patterns show clear commute-time usage peaks at 8 AM and 6 PM.
-  Higher rentals are observed during warmer, moderately humid days.
-  Winter months show the lowest rental volume, suggesting a strong seasonal influence.
